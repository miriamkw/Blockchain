# Questions and Confusions

## Why does dezentralized web need TLD (Top Level Domains)? 
If todays standard of top level domains are prone to regulations and cenzoring, what is the difference in decentralized web? 
With Unstoppable domains, domains are a one time payment. They have created a blockchain hosting several big TLDs. So someone else is still sort of "in charge" of your domain. What is the difference? 

Here is an article showing the complexities behind owning a TLD, https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/.


## Building dApps on Ethereum (for example) vs. TLD vs. SLD
Ethereum is probably more expensive.
